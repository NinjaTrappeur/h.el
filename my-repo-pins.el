;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Open source developers often have to jump between projects, either
;; to read code, or to craft patches. My Repo Pins reduces the
;; friction so that it becomes trivial to do so.

;; The idea of the plugin is based on this idea; if the repository
;; URLs can be translated to a filesystem location, the local disk can
;; be used like a cache. My Repo Pins lazily clones the repo to the
;; filesystem location if needed, and then jumps into the project in
;; one single command. You don't have to remember where you put the
;; project on the local filesystem because it's always using the same
;; location. Something like this:

;; ├── codeberg.org
;; │   └── Freeyourgadget
;; │       └── Gadgetbridge
;; └── github.com
;;     ├── BaseAdresseNationale

;;         └── my-repo-pins.el
;;
;; The main entry point of this package is the my-repo-pins command.
;; Using it, you can either:
;;
;; - Open Dired in a local project you already cloned.
;; - Query remote forges for a repository, clone it, and finally open
;;   Dired in the clone directory.
;; - Clone a git clone URL and open Dired to the right directory.
;;
;; The minimal configuration consists in setting the directory in
;; which you want to clone all your git repositories via the
;; my-repo-pins-code-root variable.
;;
;; Let's say you'd like to store all your git repositories in the
;; ~/code-root directory. You'll want to add the following snippet in
;; your Emacs configuration file:
;;
;;    (require 'my-repo-pins)
;;    (setq my-repo-pins-code-root "~/code-root")
;;
;; You can then call the M-x my-repo-pins command to open a
;; project living in your ~/code-root directory or clone a new
;; project in your code root.
;;
;; Binding this command to a global key binding might make things a
;; bit more convenient. I personally like to bind it to M-h. You can
;; add the following snippet to your Emacs configuration to set up
;; this key binding:
;;
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "M-h") 'my-repo-pins)
